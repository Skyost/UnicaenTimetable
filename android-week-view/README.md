Android Week View
=================

**Android Week View** is an Android library for displaying calendar views within an app. It was initially developed by [Raquib-ul Alam](https://github.com/alamkanak), but is not currently maintained and does not work when using API level 28. Therefore, Iâ€™m providing this fork.

Features
---------
* Display single-day or multi-day calendar views in your app
* Extensive styling customization possible
* Infinite horizontal scrolling
* Interactive via event click listeners
* Interoperable with Kotlin

Usage
---------
1. Add the JitPack repository to your project-level build file and the dependency to the app-level build file.
```groovy
// build.gradle (project-level)
allprojects {
 repositories {
  ...
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
 }
}

// build.gradle (app-level)
implementation 'com.github.thellmund:Android-Week-View:3.3'
```

2. Add `WeekView` in your XML layout.
```xml
<com.alamkanak.weekview.WeekView
    android:id="@+id/weekView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:eventTextColor="@color/white"
    app:timeColumnTextSize="12sp"
    app:hourHeight="60dp"
    app:timeColumnPadding="8dp"
    app:timeColumnTextColor="@color/light_blue"
    app:timeColumnBackgroundColor="@color/white"
    app:headerRowPadding="12dp"
    app:columnGap="8dp"
    app:numberOfVisibleDays="3"
    app:headerRowBackgroundColor="@color/light_gray"
    app:dayBackgroundColor="@color/white"
    app:todayBackgroundColor="@color/light_blue"/>
```

3. Prepare the class of objects that you want to display in `WeekView` by implementing `WeekViewDisplayable<T>`.
```java
public class CalendarItem implements WeekViewDisplayable<CalendarItem> {

    private long id;
    private String title;
    private DateTime startTime;
    private DateTime endTime;
    private String location;
    private int color;
    
    /* ... */
    
    @Override
    public WeekViewEvent<CalendarItem> toWeekViewEvent() {
        // Note: It's important to pass "this" as the last argument to WeekViewEvent's constructor.
        // This way, the EventClickListener can return this object in its onEventClick() method.
        boolean isAllDay = DateUtils.isAllDay(startTime, endTime);
        return new WeekViewEvent<>(
            id, title, startTime.toGregorianCalendar(), 
            endTime.toGregorianCalendar(), location, color, isAllDay, this
        );
    }

}
```

4. Configure `WeekView` in code.
```java
WeekView<CalendarItem> weekView = (WeekView) findViewById(R.id.weekView);
weekView.setOnEventClickListener(new EventClickListener<CalendarItem>() {
    @Override
    public void onEventClick(CalendarItem event, RectF eventRect) {
        // Do something with the CalendarItem
    }
});

// WeekView has infinite horizontal scrolling. Therefore, you need to provide the events 
// of a month whenever that the currently displayed month changes.
weekView.setMonthChangeListener(new MonthLoader.MonthChangeListener<CalendarItem>() {
    @Override
    public List<WeekViewDisplayable<CalendarItem>> onMonthChange(Calendar startDate, Calendar endDate) {
        return mDatabase.getCalendarItemsInRange(startDate, endDate);
    }
});
```
